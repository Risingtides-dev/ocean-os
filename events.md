type:      [feature-request]: Load .ocean/AGENTS.md project instructions
area:      [agent-building]: System prompt project context

Updated `crates/ocean-agent/src/lib.rs` so Ocean project prompt discovery includes `.ocean/AGENTS.md` alongside `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `.pi/instructions.md`. Added a unit test proving nested project cwd resolution loads an ancestor `.ocean/AGENTS.md` contract. Migrated from the former `.ocean/events.md` ledger when the canonical repo ledger was established.

area:      [agent-building]: .ocean instruction loading

Added `.ocean/AGENTS.md` as an Ocean-native project instruction contract, normalized event ledger naming to lowercase `events.md`, and kept the former `.ocean/events.md` ledger updated for the `.ocean/AGENTS.md` loading work and cwd/spawn-root review. Migrated into the canonical repo ledger during devlog protocol cleanup.

type:      [workflow]: Incomplete Stitchpad join attempt as nancy
area:      [skill/mcp]: Stitchpad workspace coordination

Attempted to join the existing `.stitchpad` room as `nancy` through the Stitchpad MCP join tool. This only created an MCP/pad-default presence with no kitty target or visible terminal identity, so it was removed and replaced by an explicit kitty-bound join. Migrated from the former `.ocean/events.md` ledger.

Rejoined the existing `.stitchpad` room as `nancy` with explicit kitty target `unix:/tmp/kitty-thoth-675@@105`, bound session `105` to `nancy`, set this terminal title to `nancy`, and changed the stable Stitchpad color override for `nancy` to cyan so it is visually distinct from Roger. Migrated from the former `.ocean/events.md` ledger.

Addressed Knox review blockers for the ocean-os devlog rollout: added a top `AGENTS.md` source-of-truth pointer to `CLAUDE.md`, created `crates/AGENTS.md` and six crate child docs, converted `docs/AGENTS.md` to the six-section child shape, migrated historical `.ocean/events.md` entries into the root canonical ledger, removed the secondary `.ocean/events.md` ledger, and updated root `AGENTS.md` to mention the required root `events.md` entry with `worktree:` during devlog closeout.

area:      [agent-building]: session/workspace binding

Coordinated and verified the Ocean workspace-binding milestone: `crates/ocean-tui/src/main.rs` now auto-resumes exactly one session scoped to the launch cwd while zero or multiple matches create a new session, and `crates/ocean-agent/src/lib.rs` now rebinds session workspace metadata when resumed from a different workspace root while preserving same-project bindings. Verified `cargo check -p ocean-agent -p ocean-tui`, `cargo test -p ocean-agent bind_workspace_rebinds`, and `cargo check --workspace`; Knox review passed with the slice build-clean and scoped.

worktree: [main]
type:  [bug report]: cwd binding still leaked daemon cwd through live binaries and legacy routes
area:  [backend]: daemon/runtime session cwd binding

Investigated Smaths's report that opening Ocean TUI and sending a prompt still clung to the daemon launch directory. Found the actual live state: `ocean` pointed at an old release TUI, the serving daemon was stale/manual, filesystem tools needed full SessionContext cwd binding, `glob` still ignored cwd, and legacy `/v1/prompt` routes still accepted empty cwd/returned daemon process cwd. Fixed `glob` cwd resolution, fixed smoke tests for non-unit tool structs, made `AgentRuntime::prompt` report request cwd instead of process cwd, made legacy prompt/create-request routes resolve cwd via `resolve_cwd_for_turn`, updated daemon/runtime contracts, built release TUI+daemon, restarted a single release daemon by specific PID from neutral `/private/tmp`, and verified `/health` plus legacy prompt cwd behavior.

Verification:
- `cargo fmt --check`
- `cargo test -p ocean-runtime glob_resolves_relative_pattern_against_bound_cwd`
- `cargo test -p ocean-runtime --test tools_smoke`
- `cargo check -p ocean-agent -p ocean-daemon -p ocean-tui`
- `cargo build -p ocean-daemon -p ocean-tui --release`
- `curl http://127.0.0.1:4780/health`
- `POST /v1/prompt` with blank prompt and temp cwd returned that temp cwd; blank prompt with no cwd now returns 400 instead of daemon cwd fallback.

type:  [bug report]: resume cwd now follows the caller launch directory
area:  [backend]: daemon/session cwd binding

Changed the daemon turn path so the caller's launch cwd is the execution cwd on resume, refreshed session cwd metadata on every bind, rebinds workspace_root/git metadata when the caller crosses projects, kept the TUI on the launch cwd instead of swapping to the stored session root, updated the workspace-binding note plus the crate AGENTS contracts, and refreshed the regression tests to match. Verified `cargo check -p ocean-daemon --quiet`, `cargo test -p ocean-agent bind_workspace_ --quiet`, `cargo test -p ocean-tui summary_from_detail_carries_resume_critical_fields --quiet`, and `cargo fmt --check` passed; daemon test compilation is still blocked by a pre-existing unrelated error at `crates/ocean-daemon/src/main.rs:14740` (`WriteTool` construction).

type:  [bug report]: tool loops consumed turn budget without final assistant reply
area:  [backend]: runtime agent-loop tool synthesis

Investigated Smaths's report that Ocean agents do not return to a user-visible reply after tool calls. The live daemon log showed the concrete failure shape: a single turn repeatedly alternated provider rounds and `edit` tool executions until round 32, then hit `max_turns` with the last transcript message as a tool result instead of assistant text. Fixed `ocean-runtime` so the final provider round after a tool result hides tools and injects an explicit synthesis instruction, forcing the model to answer from tool results instead of spending the last budget slot on another tool. Added a fallback assistant text if a tool result still reaches the turn limit, updated the runtime contract, rebuilt release TUI+daemon, and restarted the daemon by exact listener PID from neutral `/private/tmp`.

Verification:
- `cargo fmt --check`
- `cargo test -p ocean-runtime final_round_after_tool_result_disables_tools_and_forces_reply`
- `cargo test -p ocean-runtime glob_resolves_relative_pattern_against_bound_cwd`

type:  [bug report]: terminal provider replies after tools were invisible on SSE
area:  [backend]: runtime agent-loop event streaming

Investigated the recurring Ocean behavior where TUI and web turns looked like they stopped after tool output and required a manual "keep going" prompt. Found the shared path is the runtime/daemon event rail: both clients render assistant words from `AssistantTextDelta`, while `/v1/agent/turns` intentionally does not replay `stdout` at completion. Added a runtime guard so assistant text present in a provider's terminal `Done` message is emitted as `TextDelta` when the provider did not stream text chunks, and added a regression test for the tool-result -> terminal-final-text path. Updated the `ocean-runtime` devlog contract.

Verification:
- `cargo test -p ocean-runtime terminal_done_text_after_tool_result_is_emitted_as_text_delta -- --nocapture`
- `cargo test -p ocean-runtime`
- `cargo fmt --package ocean-runtime --check`
- `cargo check --workspace`
- `cargo build -p ocean-daemon --release`
- restarted daemon by exact old listener PID `77477`; rebuilt daemon is PID `14023` in tmux session `ocean-daemon`
- `curl http://127.0.0.1:4780/health`

type:  [refactor]: smart-commit the uncommitted daemon tree (39 files) into 5 logical commits + push
area:  [backend]: daemon/runtime git hygiene

Triaged 39 uncommitted files in the working tree that carried a week of daemon
stabilization work (cwd-binding leak fix, agent-loop synthesis after tool
results, terminal-text SSE fix, the new ocean-hooks crate, and the devlog
AGENTS.md hierarchy) existing only in the working tree and the running release
binary — a silent-regression landmine. Split into 5 conventional commits:
1. docs(devlog): AGENTS.md hierarchy + events ledger
2. fix(runtime): force synthesis after tool results + emit terminal text as TextDelta
3. fix(runtime): bind tools to SessionContext cwd + resolve relative patterns
4. feat(hooks): plugin-agnostic lifecycle hooks crate + daemon config wiring
5. docs(specs): SubprocessProvider spec
Rebased onto origin/main (resolved CLAUDE.md→OCEAN.md rename cleanly via git
rename detection; my devlog line landed in OCEAN.md). cargo check --workspace
green before and after rebase. Pushed: f58cd9d..2e83e8b.

Verification:
- cargo check --workspace (pre-commit, post-rebase)
- git log --oneline origin/main..HEAD (5 commits)
- git rev-list --left-right --count origin/main...HEAD (0/0 synced)

worktree:  main (hygiene + foundation across short-lived branches)
type:      [feature-request]
area:      [backend]

Loop/goal tick driving the coworker-onboarding + folder-as-agent direction.
(1) Git hygiene: 228 local branches -> ~8. Fanout subagents verified every
"unmerged" feature/fix branch (ocean-271/277/339/340 + 12 more) was already on
main under different commits (phantom branches), plus 47 patch-applied + 3
misrouted campaign-hub branches deleted; all dead worktrees removed, tree = main.
(2) Fixed a real CI-blocking runtime bug (PR #233, merged): the daemon TEST
build failed E0423 because a test built WriteTool as a unit struct after it
gained fields+new() — broke CI on EVERY open PR; one-line WriteTool::new() fix,
verified `cargo test -p ocean-daemon --no-run`.
(3) PR #231: ocean-coworker-onboarding skill — download-and-run onboarding to
ocean-bedrock (scoped Bearer token, /api/v1/info verify, read+write smoke),
every command verified against a live bedrock instance.
(4) PR #232: folder-as-agent resolver (crates/ocean-agent/src/agentdir.rs) —
eve.dev-style, Rust-native. Agent = folder, identity from path; agent.toml +
instructions.md + skills/ + tools/ + subagents/. agent.toml `capabilities` is
the binding contract to CapabilityProviders; spec docs/specs/folder-as-agent.md
documents the 3-tier sideload model (data / subprocess-binary / wasm) that lets
a compiled capability load without a daemon rebuild. 4 unit tests green.
#231 + #232 rebased onto the #233-fixed main, CI re-running.

Verification:
- cargo test -p ocean-agent agentdir (4 passed)
- cargo test -p ocean-daemon --no-run (clean after fix)
- cargo build -p ocean-agent / -p ocean-daemon (clean)
- PR #233 merged to main (98c11e4)

Folder-as-agent now END-TO-END live (PRs #234, #235 merged). Define an agent
as a folder -> GET /v1/agents discovers/resolves it -> AgentTurnRequest.agent
runs it on a turn. #234: read-only classification surface (GET /v1/agents +
/v1/agents/{name}, OCEAN_AGENTS_DIR root). #235: optional `agent` field on
AgentTurnRequest; when set the turn handler prepends the resolved agent's
instructions.md as a steering layer on the prompt (same additive layering as
apply_turn_guidance) — never touches permissions/tools/AgentRuntime system
prompt. agent:None = every existing client (TUI/ACP/voice/SDK) byte-for-byte
unchanged. Fail-open on missing/invalid.

Verification: ocean-agent-sdk 45 tests, daemon agents_endpoints test, daemon
test build clean, 4 affected crates build clean. Session total: 5 PRs merged
(#231 onboarding skill, #232 agentdir foundation, #233 CI-unblock runtime fix,
#234 endpoints, #235 turn wiring) + branches 228->6.

NEXT (John's ask): get the call-agent (ocean-call) 100% dialed in. Recon queued.

Onboarding SYSTEM shipped (PR #236, merged): `ocean-rs onboard --bedrock-url X
--token Y` verifies a bedrock token against /api/v1/info, prints the resolved
principal + the two env exports, exit 0/1 scriptable. Pairs with the onboarding
skill (#231). Verified end-to-end against live bedrock (success + 403 paths).
Goal "onboard people with an API token" substantially met (CLI system + skill).

Session total: 6 PRs merged (#231 skill, #232 agentdir, #233 CI-unblock bug,
#234 /v1/agents endpoints, #235 turn-path agent wiring, #236 onboard CLI),
branches 228->6, ocean-call confirmed healthy (159 tests green).

BLOCKED on John's clarification (ambiguous goal terms, can't build correctly
without): (a) "EC details" — what is EC? (b) "feedback box / information layer
merge+migrate" — which data, which store, source->dest? (c) call-agent "100%
dialed in" — which seam is rough (live phone path / STT-TTS failover / wake+
barge-in)? Next autonomous-buildable item if still away: ocean-call hardening
pass or full TUISF interactive onboarding surface.

Cron tick: fanout bug-hunt (3 parallel read-only agents over runtime/daemon/
call) -> 3 verified P1 fixes shipped (PR #237, merged). (1) read tool panicked
on offset past EOF (start>end slice) — model-triggerable turn teardown; clamp
start. (2) web_fetch panicked on UTF-8 char boundary when truncating a >8000B
non-ASCII page; extracted truncate_to_budget() walking to nearest boundary.
(3) ocean-call Deepgram streaming segment start_ms was wall-clock epoch not
call-relative (connect hardcoded started_ms:0) — threaded call-start epoch in,
matching the batch path. Directly hardens the call-agent John wants dialed in.
Daemon hunt came back clean (well-hardened, only P2 theoretical notes).

Verified: ocean-runtime 61 tests (2 new regression), ocean-call 159 tests,
deepgram-stt feature build, daemon build — all green. Session: 7 PRs merged.
Worktree clean (main only). Still awaiting John on EC / feedback-box / which
call-agent seam beyond this.
